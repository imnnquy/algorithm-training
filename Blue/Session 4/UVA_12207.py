# Your government has finally solved the
# problem of universal health care! Now
# everyone, rich or poor, will finally have
# access to the same level of medical care.
# Hurrah!
# There’s one minor complication. All
# of the country’s hospitals have been condensed
# down into one location, which can
# only take care of one person at a time.
# But don’t worry! There is also a plan
# in place for a fair, efficient computerized
# system to determine who will be admitted.
# You are in charge of programming
# this system.
# Every citizen in the nation will be assigned
# a unique number, from 1 to P
# (where P is the current population). They will be put into a queue, with 1 in front of 2, 2 in front of
# 3, and so on. The hospital will process patients one by one, in order, from this queue. Once a citizen
# has been admitted, they will immediately move from the front of the queue to the back.
# Of course, sometimes emergencies arise; if you’ve just been run over by a steamroller, you can’t wait
# for half the country to get a routine checkup before you can be treated! So, for these (hopefully rare)
# occasions, an expedite command can be given to move one person to the front of the queue. Everyone
# else’s relative order will remain unchanged.
# Given the sequence of processing and expediting commands, output the order in which citizens will
# be admitted to the hospital.

# Input
# Input consists of at most ten test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing P, the population
# of your country (1 ≤ P ≤ 1000000000), and C, the number of commands to process (1 ≤ C ≤ 1000).
# The next C lines each contain a command of the form ‘N’, indicating the next citizen is to be
# admitted, or ‘E x’, indicating that citizen x is to be expedited to the front of the queue.
# The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.
# Output
# For each test case print the serial of output. This is followed by one line of output for each ‘N’ command,
# indicating which citizen should be processed next. Look at the output for sample input for details.
# Sample Input
