# algorithm-training
## About
This is my training code to practise Algorithm, resources are from [BigO Coding](http://bigocoding.com/ "BigO Coding"), [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/ "Codeforces"), [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/ "SPOJ"), [UVA](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/ "UVA"), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/ "Codechef"), [LightOJ](http://lightoj.com "LightOJ"), [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com "Hackerrank") [Hackerearth](https://hackerearth.com "Hackerearth"), [URIOnlineJudge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en "URIOnlineJudge")  .

## Changes
As initially planned, I tried to use only Python to take the chance learning it while practising Algorithm, but after getting `TLE` issues, I had to use C++ for some problems. I haven't used C++ for some years so it has been quite difficult for me to get familiar with it. But by the end of the day, everything was going well so this repository contained both `C++` and `Python`.

IMHO, `1 vote` for the beauty of `Python` and `1 vote` for the performance of `C++`.

## Tools
I use VSCode + IORun extension, I'd recommend anyone interested in Competitive Programming to try this extension as it's really useful to run and test your result. Readmore about the extension here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoangnc.io-run
