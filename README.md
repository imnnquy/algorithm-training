# algorithm-training
This is my training code to practise Algorithm, resources are from [BigO Coding](http://bigocoding.com/ "BigO Coding"), [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/ "Codeforces"), [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/ "SPOJ"), [UVA](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/ "UVA"), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/ "Codechef"), [LightOJ](http://lightoj.com "LightOJ"), [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com "Hackerrank") [Hackerearth](https://hackerearth.com "Hackerearth") .

Initially, I planned to use Python only as I'd like to take this chance learning Python, but after getting TLE issues, I had to use C++ for some problems. I haven't use C++ for some years so it's quite difficult for me to get familiar with it. But at the end of the day, everything was going well since the most important thing is the programming mindset, not specific in any language.

IMHO, `1 vote` for the beauty of `Python` and `1 vote` for the crazy performance of `C++`.
