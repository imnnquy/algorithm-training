## About
This is my training code to practise Algorithm, resources are from [BigO Coding](http://bigocoding.com/ "BigO Coding"), [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/ "Codeforces"), [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/ "SPOJ"), [UVA](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/ "UVA"), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/ "Codechef"), [LightOJ](http://lightoj.com "LightOJ"), [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com "Hackerrank") [Hackerearth](https://hackerearth.com "Hackerearth"), [URIOnlineJudge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en "URIOnlineJudge")  .

## Programming languages
This repository contains both `Python` and `C++` as many solutions will get `TLE` if they're implemented in Python, but `C++` works well for those cases.

Most of the solutions are implemented in `Python`, `C++` is only used for ones which time limits are too strict.

## Tools
I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VSCode") <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a> + [IORun extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoangnc.io-run "IORun extension"), I'd recommend anyone interested in Competitive Programming to try this extension as it's really useful to run and test your result.
